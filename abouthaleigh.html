	<p>I am currently a student at Saint Joseph's University located in Philadelphia, PA. At the end of this year, I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in English. I am also minoring in both Communications and Theatre Arts. I am extremely interested in the field of publishing, specifically edittorial work, and I hope to get a job with a book publishing company after graduation.</p>
	<p>At Saint Joseph's University, I am involved in a few extracurricular activities in addition to my studies. During my freshman year, and again this year, I have been involved in doing technical work with the SJU Theatre Company. I helped to run the soundboard for a few shows as well as helping to help out backstage. In addition to the theatre, I am part of the Crimson and Grey Literary Magazine, which is published annually in the spring. I have lots of experience working in both of these areas since I was also involved in them in high school, and I worked at a theatre in my hometown for two summers.</p>
	<p>Outside of school, I have varied interests. Mainly, I like to read and write. I read almost anything, except for sci-fi. In terms of writing, I love to write creatively, meaning short stories, poetry, and prose. I also enjoy watching movies and listening to almost every genre of music. I love all aspects of theatre. While I consider myself to be almost strictly a "techie," I have also acted in several shows and had my first experiencing directing a short play this fall. To date, I have only seen two Broadway shows, but I hope to add many more to my repertoire. In the spring, I will be running a soundboard for Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman, which will be my last college show.</p>
	<p>So far, I do not have much experience with web design and development. In fact, I just took my first class on it this fall. However, I will be taking an advanced class in the spring because I found that I have gained an interest in it. I am interested in learning more about different design aspects as well as different programming languages. I hope this experience will aid me in my career search and eventually my career.</p>
	<p>I hope you have enjoyed my website. If you have any comments or questions about it, please feel free to contact me in one of the ways listed below here.</p>
